## 3. Your custom app step by step

In some of the steps it is the easiest to copy and adapt configuration settings, folders and files from an existing flavor.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your event, e.g. `awesome-event-2021`
3. Add a new product flavor in *app/build.gradle* e.g. `awesome2021` and the corresponding folder e.g. `app/src/awesome2021`
4. Configure all required properties in your flavor (`applicationId`, `versionName`, `buildConfigField`, `resValue`)
5. Enable showing the app disclaimer via `SHOW_APP_DISCLAIMER` to acknowledge its origin
6. Add a new signing config in `app/gradle.properties`
7. Customize texts for the languages which you want to offer (`values/strings.xml`, `values-de/strings.xml`, ...)
8. Add the name/s (and website/s) of the authors of the logo(s) in `copyright_logo`
9. Add track resource names in `res/xml/track_resource_names.xml`
10. Customize track colors in `res/values/colors_congress.xml`
11. Customize app colors in `res/values/colors.xml`
12. Verify colors both in light and dark mode (not all screens switch colors!)
13. Add a launcher icon in different resolutions as `res/mipmap-[...]/ic_launcher.png`
14. Add a notification icon in different resolutions as `res/drawable-[...]/ic_notification.png`
15. Add an about dialog logo as `res/drawable/dialog_logo.xml`
16. Customize bell and video recording icons in `res/drawable/` (optional)

### 3.1. Customizing illustrations shown at empty screens

The app shows illustrations on empty screens. You can customize these illustrations which fit the
look and feel of your event by importing **your own SVG files** as vector drawables to the
`res/drawable/` folder of **your product flavor**, e.g. `app/src/awesome2021/res/drawable/`.
If the same file names are used than your illustrations will replace the default ones in `main`.
The following default illustrations (vector drawables) are present in the app:

- No alarms: `app/src/main/res/drawable/no_alarms.xml`
- No favorites: `app/src/main/res/drawable/no_favorites.xml`
- No schedule: `app/src/main/res/drawable/no_schedule.xml`
- No schedule changes: `app/src/main/res/drawable/no_schedule_changes.xml`
- No search results: `app/src/main/res/drawable/no_search_results.xml`

The original raw SVG files can be found in `assets/empty-states/`, more information is available in the
associated [README](../assets/empty-states/README.md).

## 4. Optional customization

The following options can be enabled via a `buildConfigField` and configured in *app/build.gradle* as needed.

- Event postal address for easy map navigation via `EVENT_POSTAL_ADDRESS`
- Social media hashtags/handles for the event via `SOCIAL_MEDIA_HASHTAGS_HANDLES`
- Alternative schedule URL via `ENABLE_ALTERNATIVE_SCHEDULE_URL`
- c3nav integration via `C3NAV_URL`
- Chaosflix export via `ENABLE_CHAOSFLIX_EXPORT`
- Engelsystem shifts via `ENABLE_ENGELSYSTEM_SHIFTS`
  - Customize the name for the Engelsystem via `engelsystem_alias`
  - Customize the name for the Engelsystem shifts via `engelsystem_shifts_alias`
  - Customize Engelsystem shifts JSON export URL hint via `preference_hint_engelsystem_json_export_url`
- Feedback system via `SCHEDULE_FEEDBACK_URL`
- FOSDEM room status via `ENABLE_FOSDEM_ROOM_STATUS`, `FOSDEM_ROOM_STATES_URL`, `FOSDEM_ROOM_STATES_PATH`

## 5. Optional engagements

- c3nav app installation via `ENGAGE_C3NAV_APP_INSTALLATION`
- Google Play beta testing via `ENGAGE_GOOGLE_BETA_TESTING`
- Google Play rating via `ENGAGE_GOOGLE_PLAY_RATING`
- to learn about the screen estate in landscape mode via `ENGAGE_LANDSCAPE_ORIENTATION`

## 6. Development features

The following features are available when the build type is "debug". They are located in the
"Development" section of the "Settings" screen. They are intended for the preparation phase of the
app to verify that the schedule data is loaded and processed correctly.

### Schedule statistic

The "Schedule statistic" screen shows the distribution of null or empty and non-empty fields in
the "sessions" database table. This can be useful for identify missing data in the schedule.
