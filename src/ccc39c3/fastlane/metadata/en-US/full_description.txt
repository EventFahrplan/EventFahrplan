The 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3) takes place in Hamburg on 27–30 Dec
2025, and is the 2025 edition of the annual four-day conference on technology,
society and utopia organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and volunteers.

Congress offers lectures and workshops and various events on a multitude of
topics including (but not limited to) information technology and generally a
critical-creative attitude towards technology and the discussion about the
effects of technological advances on society.

Starting in 1984, Congress has been organized by the community and appreciates
all kinds of participation. You are encouraged to contribute by volunteering,
setting up and hosting hands-on and self-organized events with the other
components of your assembly or presenting your own projects to fellow hackers.
