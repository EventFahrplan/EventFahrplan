# Contribution guide

You are very welcome to contribute to this project.
In order to simplify the process please try to follow the following suggestions:

* Create an issue to discuss your idea before you invest a lot of time into coding.
* Fork the repository into your personal GitHub account to start working.
* Create a separate branch for each topic.
* Use contextual atomic commits.
* Make sure each commit compiles.
* Rebase your branch onto the latest commit on `master`.
* Do not merge `master` into your branch. The project maintainer will merge your branch into `master` instead.
* Describe the intention of your pull request. Screenshots help others to understand the before and after state.
* Feel free to reorganize the commits on your branch by using `git rebase --interactive` or `git push --force`.
* Make sure to apply [automatic code formatting and organize imports][code-formatting] as it is provided by Android Studio.
* Write unit tests.
